<h2>Contributing:</h2>
<p>In order to contribute to this project, kindly share your thought process as you develop and / or design, with due explanation to your thought process, and documentation for your technical work where necessary. However, if the design and code is self-evident, which is the ideal, you don't have to document just for the sake of it. Keep it neat and clean, and remember that simple is better more often than not.</p>
<p>The idea behind building this e-commerce store was to keep it clean, neat, and of a light-hearted nature. I have the impression that Norwegians that are happy to explore nature and for hiking in general, are optimistic people with few concerns in their lives. So adapting the general tone of the web page to their mood was the intention behind the design. So please keep that in mind while contributing to the web page.</p>
<p>And as always: Keep in mind a few lessons from some of the all-time greats, such as Jeff Besoz behind Amazon. His vision is to create the world's most customer centric company. And while developing Rainy Days, please keep the same vision in mind. All changes, improvements, and additions, should be with the purpose of making the UX for the customer more user friendly, simpler, quicker, and providing them with more value. Solving their problems effectively. Not to solve some of your own needs, such as a cookie banner, just because everyone else is doing it.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgements from Johan Lossius:</h2>
<p>I'd like to acknowledge Noroff for providing me with a great and flexible study so that I can keep learning while being busy with my own company. What I particularly liked was the pragmatism of the study, free from inapplicable theory that has no other use than to kill creativity, and full of pragmatic tools, tricks and knowledge to be used in the field of frontend development and design.</p>
<p>Also I'd liked to acknowledge the tutors that have helped me along, grading my work and providing feedback and tips when necessary.</p>
